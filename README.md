About Me
I am a researcher with a focus on Computer Vision and Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs). My special interest lies in applying these technologies to the prevention of geological disasters. My aim is to integrate state-of-the-art computational techniques with real-world challenges to improve predictions and mitigation strategies for natural hazards.
